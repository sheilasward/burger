# Burger Application "Eat-Da-Burger" using Node Express Handlebars

### Overview

This assignment is a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It incorporates the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern.  Node and MySQL are used to query and route data, and Handlebars is used to generate the HTML.

### Deployment Note

This assignment is on github, and is deployed on Heroku at:  https://shielded-river-30768.herokuapp.com/

### About the application

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
